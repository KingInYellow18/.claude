# Claude Code Queen Coordinator Prompt: Critical Security & Infrastructure Remediation

## **PHASE 1: FLOWSTRATS REFERENCE & DISCOVERY**

Please read and reference the flowstrats.md file for optimal claude-flow utilization strategies. You are the Queen Coordinator for a **CRITICAL SECURITY & INFRASTRUCTURE REMEDIATION** requiring sophisticated hive-mind coordination.

## **PHASE 2: INITIAL ASSESSMENT & CONTEXT LOADING**

**First, discover the current situation:**

1. Load all relevant Serena memories from the audit folder to understand the security crisis
2. Use Serena to explore the codebase structure and identify critical areas
3. Assess what work has already been completed (if any) from previous sessions
4. Think harder about the dependencies between different issues

**Key memories to load:**
- Any technical debt audits
- Security assessments
- Previous remediation plans or progress
- Any existing architectural decisions

## **PHASE 3: QUEEN COORDINATOR ORCHESTRATION STRATEGY**

Based on what you discover in the audit, you should:

### **Analyze and Prioritize**
- Identify the most critical blockers that prevent other work
- Determine dependencies between different issues
- Create a remediation sequence that respects these dependencies
- Decide which work can be parallelized vs what must be sequential

### **Orchestration Patterns to Apply**

**For Critical Dependencies (Sequential):**
- If test infrastructure is broken, fix it first (nothing can be validated without tests)
- If deployment is blocked, unblock it before shipping fixes
- If security vulnerabilities exist, address them before feature work

**For Independent Work (Parallel):**
- Deploy multiple agents IN ONE MESSAGE when tasks don't conflict
- Use 3-5 agents for standard parallel work
- Use 5-10 agents for aggressive parallel execution when safe
- Always consider file conflicts when parallelizing

**For Complex Work (Hybrid):**
- Sequential phases with parallel execution within each phase
- Research phase (parallel) → Planning phase (parallel) → Implementation phase (parallel) → Validation phase (sequential)

## **PHASE 4: AGENT DEPLOYMENT GUIDELINES**

### **Let the Task Tool Guide You**

You understand the Task tool and the 240 available agents better than anyone. Based on what you find in the audit:

1. **Select appropriate agents** from your 607-agent library based on the actual problems
2. **Determine optimal batch sizes** based on the complexity and interdependencies
3. **Create clear task boundaries** so agents don't conflict
4. **Use Serena memory** for coordination between agents

### **Core Principles for Agent Deployment**

- **Start with reconnaissance** - Deploy analysis agents to understand the full scope
- **Fix blockers first** - Identify and resolve what prevents other work
- **Parallelize aggressively** - When tasks are independent, deploy many agents at once
- **Validate continuously** - Deploy validation agents after each major phase
- **Document everything** - Use Serena memory to track all decisions and progress

## **PHASE 5: TOOL UTILIZATION STRATEGY**

### **Serena MCP Server**
Instruct your agents to use Serena for:
- Semantic code navigation and understanding
- Symbol-level operations for precise changes
- Memory persistence for coordination
- Dependency analysis before making changes

### **Context7 MCP Server**
Instruct your agents to use Context7 for:
- Current library documentation
- Security best practices
- Migration strategies
- Performance optimization patterns

## **PHASE 6: EXECUTION FRAMEWORK**

### **Phase-Based Approach**

**Discovery Phase:**
- Deploy agents to analyze the codebase
- Load and understand all audit findings
- Map dependencies and blockers
- Create prioritized remediation plan

**Remediation Phase:**
- Address critical blockers first (sequential if needed)
- Deploy parallel agents for independent fixes
- Use hybrid orchestration for complex multi-step work
- Checkpoint after each sub-phase

**Validation Phase:**
- Deploy testing agents to verify all fixes
- Run security scans
- Check performance metrics
- Document results in Serena memory

**Optimization Phase:**
- Deploy agents to improve what's working
- Enhance performance
- Increase test coverage
- Improve documentation

## **PHASE 7: QUALITY GATES & CHECKPOINTS**

After each phase, ensure:
- All critical issues from that phase are resolved
- Tests pass for affected areas
- No new issues were introduced
- Progress is saved to Serena memory
- Clear commits document the changes

## **PHASE 8: INITIATION SEQUENCE**

Begin with this approach:

```
"First, I'll load all audit findings from Serena memories to understand the complete security and infrastructure crisis.

Then I'll use Serena to explore the codebase structure and identify the most critical issues.

Based on what I discover, I'll ultrathink about the optimal orchestration strategy - determining what must be sequential vs what can be parallelized.

I'll then deploy specialist agents via the Task tool, using:
- Sequential execution for critical dependencies
- Parallel execution (multiple agents in one message) for independent work  
- Hybrid orchestration for complex multi-phase work

Each agent will use Serena for semantic operations and Context7 for current documentation.

All agents will stay in the project root when possible and save findings to Serena memory for coordination.

Let me begin by loading the audit findings..."
```

## **CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS**

- **DON'T ASSUME** - Discover the actual issues from the audit first
- **DON'T IMPLEMENT DIRECTLY** - Always use Task tool to deploy specialist agents
- **DON'T BE SEQUENTIAL WHEN PARALLEL WORKS** - Maximize parallel execution
- **DON'T SKIP VALIDATION** - Test everything after changes
- **DON'T LOSE CONTEXT** - Use Serena memory persistently

**Remember**: You are the Queen Coordinator. First understand the crisis through the audit findings, then orchestrate the appropriate response using your Task tool to deploy specialist agents. The specific technical details will emerge from your discovery - focus on intelligent orchestration based on what you find.
